The `addTask` function should:
- accept the `todoList` and a `task` as parameters. 
- create a new task object with a property called task that contains the `task` passed as an argument and a `completed` property should be `false` for newly created tasks.
- add the task object to the `todoList` array
- return the newly added task object

The `markComplete` function should:
- accept the `todoList` and a `task` as parameters.
- find the `task` within the `todoList`.
- update the found task's `completed` property to `true`.
- return the newly updated task object

There are some questions commented out above the function within the starter code that will affect some of what you do for this one. Primarily, your approach will change depending on whether you decide to delete the task from the existing todoList or just return a new todoList without the task included.

The `removeTask` function should:
- accept the `todoList` and a `task` as parameters.
- return a `todoList` that no longer includes the task object whose `task` property matches the value passed as an argument for the `task` parameter.
